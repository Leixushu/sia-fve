\section{Introduction}  \label{sec:intro}

Consider a fluid which moves over a solid substrate.  Suppose that mass can be added or removed at the boundary of the fluid region, either by a process like precipitation or aggregation, or by phase change if we define the fluid region as being only one phase.  We describe all such addition/removal at the boundary as ``boundary sources.''  Through both flow and boundary sources, the three-dimensional region occupied by the fluid changes in time, thus the problem is of moving-boundary type.  Can a numerical model of such free-boundary fluid motion, with non-material boundary surfaces, conserve the discretized mass of the fluid exactly?  Of course there is nothing special about ``mass'' in the above; can the discretized energy or momentum of a fluid with moving boundary, given boundary source terms, be conserved exactly?

Problems of this type appear for ice sheets \cite{BLKCB,CDDSV,EgholmNielsen2010,JouvetBueler2012}, shallow water flows over marshes \cite{AlonsoSantillanaDawson}, [Dupuit-Forchheimer APPROX IN GROUNDWATER], laboratory flows \cite{Kondic,PeglerWorster2012,SayagWorster2013}, subglacial hydrology \cite{AschwandenBuelerKhroulevBlatter,BuelervanPeltDRAFT,Schoofetal2012}, supraglacial runoff (?), sea ice (?), and tsunami run-up (?), among other applications.  Within the context of ice sheet modeling, discrete mass conservation at free boundaries has a small literature \cite{Albrechtetal2011,JaroschSchoofAnslow2013} which suggests the difficulty of the problem.

Although the above literature relates to the problem we have stated, there is no theoretical guidance as to what degree such exact discrete conservation is possible.  The literature of global climate model addresses exact discrete conservation as a goal [FIXME: CITE], but always in a context without free boundary.  This paper starts a theory of exact discrete conservation for free-boundary fluid problems.

Our approach is to semi-discretize the problem in time and pose each time-step problem in weak variational form.  Each time step is a variational inequality because we look at the simplified case of fluid layers where the layer thickness is well-defined.  The positivity of thickness is the active constraint in the variational inequality form.

We identify the ``retreat area'' during the time step as fundamental.  By definition this area is the set where the fluid layer thickness is positive at the beginning of the time step, and, through flow and boundary-source terms, the thickness is zero at the end of the time step.  That is, fluid was completely lost from the retreat area at some time during the time-step.  Even for well-behaved source terms (e.g.~smooth in time and space) and short time steps, the retreat area can be of essentially arbitrary size.  For example, in a varying climate a large area of thin ice sheet or sea ice can melt, or a large area of a layer of surface water on ground can evaporate, in the duration of one time step no matter how short.  We can state our major assertion informally:
\begin{quote}
\emph{The retreat loss is not exactly balanced by a \emph{modeled} source during the discrete time-step, so a conserving model must track the retreat loss separately.}
\end{quote}

Climate models are ``multiphysics'' models which generally attempt to conserve masses of the phases of water (in particular) separately, as these phases have different physical properties relevant to earth system dynamics.  For example, snow and ice have higher albedo than liquid ocean, and different densities as well.  In such climate multiphysics models with at least one fluid having a moving free boundary, auditable mass conservation does not generally occur.  We believe this will be easier to correct once theoretical limits on discrete conservation are acknowledged, as here.  With the correction term identified here, for example, when a large area of ice sheet or sea-ice melts then the discrete-time model will both have exact conservation of the mass of water in all phases, but also it will be able to correctly report scientificially-essential mass transfers between the phases, as the phases occupy changing two- and three-dimensional regions.


\section{Continuous-time and discrete-time strong formulations}  \label{sec:strongform}

Let $\Omega \subset \RR^d$ be a bounded open region with sufficiently-regular boundary.  The time-dependent model we consider is usually stated in strong form as follows.  It combines a conservation equation, a fixed-location flux (Neumann) boundary condition, and a constraint:
\begin{align}
u_t + \Div \bq &= f(u,x,t) &&\text{in } \Omega, \text{ where } u > 0 \label{eq:massconserve} \\
\bq \cdot \bn &= g(u,x,t) &&\text{on } \partial\Omega, \text{ where } u > 0 \label{eq:fixedneumann} \\
u &\ge 0 &&\text{in } \bar\Omega. \label{eq:constraint}
\end{align}
We call the unknown $u$ the \emph{layer thickness} $u(x,t)$, for $x\in \Omega$ and $t>0$.  The manner in which the flux $\bq$ depends on the unknown $u$ or its gradient $\grad u$ is general for now,
\begin{equation}
\bq = \bq(\grad u,u,x,t), \label{eq:fluxdepends}
\end{equation}
but with more detail below in section \ref{sec:fluxassumptions}.

Constraint \eqref{eq:constraint} comes from the meaning of $u$ as a thickness, which cannot be negative.  In the time-dependent support of $u$, namely $\{(x,t) \big| u(x,t) > 0\}$, we say that the layer exists, and that it is absent in the complement.  Finding the evolution of this support, and of its free boundary, is essential to problems of this type.

Conservation equation \eqref{eq:massconserve} only applies in this strong form where the layer exists.  Similarly the boundary condition \eqref{eq:fixedneumann} only make sense in locations where $u>0$, at least in the generic case $g\ne 0$.  Well-posedness of the problem \eqref{eq:massconserve}--\eqref{eq:constraint} in fact requires a weak formulation, in which these caveats are replaced by a precise specification of admissible functions, as we do in sections \ref{sec:fluxassumptions} and \ref{sec:weakform}.

We work with the (time) semi-discretized problem.  Let $\{t_n\}_{n=0}^N$ be a sequence of increasing times on an interval $[0,T]$ with $t_0=0$ and $t_N=T$.  The semi-discretized problem determines $u_n(x) \approx u(x,t_n)$ given old values $u_{n-1}(x)$.  Corresponding to \eqref{eq:massconserve}--\eqref{eq:constraint}, the single-time-step strong form is
\begin{align}
\frac{u_n - u_{n-1}}{\Delta t} + \Div \bQ_n &= F_n &&\text{in } \Omega, \text{ where } u_n > 0 \label{eq:semimassconserve} \\
\bQ_n \cdot \bn &= G_n &&\text{on } \partial\Omega, \text{ where } u_n > 0 \label{eq:semifixedneumann} \\
u_n &\ge 0 &&\text{in } \bar\Omega \label{eq:semiconstraint}
\end{align}
Problem \eqref{eq:semimassconserve}--\eqref{eq:semiconstraint} will be restated as a weak problem in section \ref{sec:weakform}, with attention to well-posedness.

In equations \eqref{eq:semimassconserve}--\eqref{eq:semiconstraint}, the functions $\bQ_n(\grad u_n,u_n,x)$, $F_n(u_n,x)$, and $G_n(u_n,x)$ come from the semi-discretization procedure, and including various combinations of the old and new values.  For example, in the simplest implicit case of a backward Euler scheme applied to \eqref{eq:massconserve}--\eqref{eq:constraint}, we have $\bQ_n = \bq(\grad u_n,u,x,t_n)$, $F_n = f(u_n,x,t_n)$, and $G_n = g(u_n,x,t_n)$.  In the case of a trapezoid rule, however,
\begin{align*}
\bQ_n &= \frac{1}{2} \bq(\grad u_n,u_n,x,t_n), \\
F_n   &= \frac{1}{2} f(u_n,x,t_n) + \frac{1}{2} f(u_{n-1},x,t_{n-1}) - \frac{1}{2} \left(\Div \bq\right)(\grad u_{n-1},u_{n-1},x,t_{n-1}), \text{ and} \\
G_n   &= g(u_n,x,t_n).
\end{align*}
According to the time-semi-discretization procedure, $F_n$ generally ``absorbs'' various terms evaluated at times $t_{n-1}$ and time $t_n$.

To proceed with basic definitions we make two assumptions on the single-time-step strong form problem \eqref{eq:semimassconserve}--\eqref{eq:semiconstraint}.  These assumptions will continue to apply in the weak form of section \ref{sec:weakform}:
\renewcommand{\labelenumi}{(\roman{enumi})}
\begin{enumerate}
\item $F_n(v,x)$ is zeroth-order in $v$, and
\item $\bQ_n(\bX,v,x)$ is continuous in $v$ and $\bQ_n(\bX,0,x)=0$ for all $\bX\in\RR^d$ and $x\in\Omega$.
\end{enumerate}

FIXME: we can extend $G_n$ by zero to the whole of $\partial \Omega$ and not change anything.  On the flip side, as a modeler you are free to put $G_n$ zero anywhere on the boundary, but if it is nonzero then it must be that the solution $u_n$ is actually positive on that part of the boundary


\section{The retreat set and the retreat loss}  \label{sec:retreatdefn}

From \eqref{eq:semimassconserve}--\eqref{eq:semiconstraint} we decompose $\Omega$ into three disjoint regions based on $u_n$ and $u_{n-1}$:
\begin{align*}
\Omega_n &= \left\{x \in \Omega \,\big|\, u_n(x)>0\right\}, \\
\Omega_n^r &= \left\{x \in \Omega \,\big|\, u_n(x)=0 \text{ and } u_{n-1}(x) > 0\right\}, \\
\Omega_n^0 &= \left\{x \in \Omega \,\big|\, u_n(x)=0 \text{ and } u_{n-1}(x) = 0\right\},
\end{align*}
so that $\Omega = \Omega_n \cup \Omega_n^r \cup \Omega_n^0$.  Here the superscript ``$r$'' stands for ``retreat,''\footnote{At this point a symmetry has been broken.  We could have decomposed $\Omega= \Omega_n \cup \Omega_n^a \cup \Omega_n^0$ where $\Omega_n^a = \{u_n(x) > 0 \text{ and } u_{n-1}(x) = 0\}$ is the ``advance'' set.  As far as we can tell the resulting alternate theory offers no advantages or disadvantages.} and $\Omega_n^r$ is called the \emph{retreat set}.

Figure \ref{fig:domains} shows this decomposition of $\Omega$.  In this section we simply define the quantities needed to precisely restate the major assertion of section \ref{sec:intro}.  A decomposition of the boundary $\partial \Omega$ is needed to define the quantities.

\begin{figure}[ht]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=2.0in,keepaspectratio=true]{domains-fig}
\end{center}
\caption{We decompose $\Omega = \Omega_n \cup \Omega_n^r \cup \Omega_n^0$, where $\Omega_n$ the support of $u_n$, $\Omega_n^r$ is the retreat set, and $\Omega_n^0$ is the set on which both $u_{n-1}$ and $u_n$ are zero.  The boundary of $\Omega_n$ is decomposed into two pieces, $\partial\Omega_n = \Gamma_n^N \cup \Gamma_n^0$.}
\label{fig:domains}
\end{figure}

The boundary of the support $\Omega_n$ of $u_n$ decomposes into the part where a fixed (Neumann) condition applies, and a part which is the free boundary,
\begin{align*}
\partial\Omega_n &= \Gamma_n^N \cup \Gamma_n^0
\end{align*}
(superscript ``$N$'' stands for ``Neumann'').  Specifically, $\Gamma_n^0 = \Omega \cap \partial \Omega_n$ and $\Gamma_n^N = \partial \Omega \cap \partial \Omega_n$, and along $\Gamma_n^N$ the flux condition \eqref{eq:semifixedneumann} applies.  We will show [WILL WE?  PRESUMABLY ONLY IF $\bQ_n$ HAS $\grad u_n$] that along the free boundary $\Gamma_n^0$ we have both $u_n=0$ and $\bQ_n = 0$.

Now define
\begin{equation}
M_n = \int_\Omega u_n(x)\,dx, \label{eq:totalmassdefn}
\end{equation}
which we naturally call the \emph{(total) mass} at time $t_n$, and define
\begin{equation}
R_n = \int_{\Omega_n^r} u_{n-1}\,dx, \label{eq:retreatlossdefn}
\end{equation}
which we call the \emph{retreat loss} at time $t_n$.  The total mass and the retreat loss at time $t_n$ are related.  By \eqref{eq:semimassconserve}, \eqref{eq:totalmassdefn}, and \eqref{eq:retreatlossdefn} we have
\begin{align}
M_n - M_{n-1} &=  - \int_{\Omega_n^r} u_{n-1}\,dx + \int_{\Omega_n} (u_n - u_{n-1})\,dx \label{eq:massstep} \\
   &= - R_n + \Delta t \int_{\Omega_n} (- \Div \bQ_n + F_n) \,dx \notag \\
   &= - R_n + \Delta t \int_{\Gamma_n^N} G_n + \Delta t \int_{\Omega_n} F_n\,dx \notag
\end{align}
because $\bQ_n=0$ along $\Gamma_n^0$.

Given the continuous-time solution $u(x,t)$ starting with initial condition $u(x,t_{n-1}) = u_{n-1}(x)$, at points $x$ within $\Omega_n^r$ we could define the time at $u(x,t)$ first becomes zero, the \emph{loss-time function} which is well-defined on the retreat set $\Omega_n^r$:
\begin{equation}
\bar t(x) = \inf\left\{t \,\big|\, u(x,t)>0 \,\text{ and }\, t_{n-1} < t \le t_n\right\}.
\end{equation}
Observe that $\bar t(x)$ varies over $\Omega_n^r$.  Of course as $\Delta t \to 0$ then $\bar t(x) \to t_{n-1}$, and we might even expect that the area of $\Omega_n^r$ might decrease to zero, though this has not been proven.  But for numerical models, which necessarily have discrete time, the variation in $\bar t(x)$, over $\Omega_n^r$ during the time-step $t_{n-1} < t \le t_n$, is unknown.  If this uncertainty is not acknowledge then it might be a barrier to the conservation of discrete (at least, time-semi-discretized) mass.

As an operational statement about discrete-time models, we can rephrase our major assertion from the Introdcution as
\begin{quote}
\emph{The model must store a time series for $R_n$, in addition to the expected time series $\int_{\Gamma_n^N} G_n$ and $\int_{\Omega_n} F_n$, in order to provide auditable mass conservation.}
\end{quote}
In stating this assertion, we acknowledge that the retreat loss $R_n$ should vanish in the $\Delta t\to 0$ limit.


\section{Regarding the flux} \label{sec:fluxassumptions}

FIXME:  want property that for $X$ an open set,
\begin{equation}
u_n=0 \text{ on } X \quad \implies \quad \bQ_n=0 \text{ on } X  \label{eq:vanishingQn}
\end{equation}

FIXME:  want maximum principle property that
\begin{equation}
v + \alpha\, (\Div \bQ_n)(\grad v,v,x) > 0 \text{ on } X \quad \implies \quad v > 0 \text{ on } X  \label{eq:maxprincQn}
\end{equation}
for all $\alpha>0$ because the strong form \eqref{eq:semimassconserve} says $u_n + \Delta t\, \Div \bQ_n = (u_{n-1} + \Delta t\, F_n)$ and we want to conclude the contrapositive of \eqref{eq:maxprincQn} in $\Omega_n^0$ and $\Omega_n^r$ where $u_n=0$:
\begin{equation}
F_n \le 0  \text{ on } \Omega_n^0  \label{eq:inequalityonzero}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
u_{n-1} + \Delta t\, F_n \le 0  \text{ on } \Omega_n^r  \label{eq:inequalityonretreat}
\end{equation}

FIXME: if $v \in W^{1,p}(\Omega)$ then, for $1/p + 1/q = 1$,
    $$\bQ_n(\grad v,v,x) \in L^q(\Omega)$$ 


\section{Weak formulation of a time-step}  \label{sec:weakform}

The strong form \eqref{eq:semimassconserve}--\eqref{eq:semiconstraint} is generally understood to be inadequate as a description of the solutions $u_n(x)$, because the free boundary is not organically included in the problem statement, and also because the space of admissible solutions is not specified.  Here we both specify the appropriate function spaces and propose a weak form, a variational inequality \cite{Friedman,KinderlehrerStampacchia} for \eqref{eq:semimassconserve}--\eqref{eq:semiconstraint}.  This weak form can be proven to be well-posed in some cases.  In more cases the weak form can be shown to imply the strong form where the solution exists (``interior condition'').

We start by arguing informally for why the weak form, a non-obvious variational inequality, should hold.\footnote{Though the weak form is mathematically more fundamental, nonetheless history and human frailty have made the strong form more prominent in applications, especially in the climate-modeling literature where our conservation concerns are most relevant.}  Our argument uses facts which are intuitively true in the subsets of the decomposition $\Omega = \Omega_n \cup \Omega_n^r \cup \Omega_n^0$.

Suppose $v\ge 0$ is sufficiently smooth on $\Omega$.  Using the decomposition and the divergence theorem (Green's theorem),
\begin{align*}
-\int_{\Omega} \bQ_n \cdot \grad(v-u_n) &= -\int_{\Omega_n} \bQ_n \cdot \grad(v-u_n) - \int_{\Omega_n^r \cup \Omega_n^0} \bQ_n \cdot \grad(v-u_n) \\
  &= \int_{\Omega_n} (\Div \bQ_n) (v-u_n) - \int_{\Omega_n} \Div \left(\bQ_n (v-u_n)\right) \\
  &\qquad\quad + \int_{\Omega_n^r \cup \Omega_n^0} (\Div \bQ_n) (v-u_n) - \int_{\Omega_n^r \cup \Omega_n^0} \Div \left(\bQ_n (v-u_n)\right) \\
  &= \int_{\Omega_n} (\Div \bQ_n) (v-u_n) - \int_{\Gamma_n^N} G_n (v-u_n) \\
  &\qquad\quad + \int_{\Omega_n^r \cup \Omega_n^0} (\Div \bQ_n) (v-u_n)
\end{align*}
because
       $$\int_{\Gamma_n^0} (\bQ_n \cdot \bn) (v-u_n) = 0,$$
and using \eqref{eq:semifixedneumann}.  By \eqref{eq:semimassconserve} where the layer exists, namely in $\Omega_n$, we have
\begin{align}
-\int_{\Omega} \bQ_n \cdot \grad(v-u_n) &= \int_{\Omega_n} \left(F_n - \frac{u_n - u_{n-1}}{\Delta t}\right) (v-u_n) - \int_{\partial \Omega} G_n (v-u_n) \label{eq:equalitybeforeVI} \\
  &\qquad\quad + \int_{\Omega_n^r \cup \Omega_n^0} (\Div \bQ_n) (v-u_n). \notag
\end{align}
Here we have used the fact that $G_n$ extends by zero to the whole of $\partial \Omega$.

However, by \eqref{eq:vanishingQn} on $\Omega_n^0$,
    $$\int_{\Omega_n^0} (\Div \bQ_n) (v-u_n) = \int_{\Omega_n^0} (0) (v-u_n) \ge \int_{\Omega_n^0} \left(F_n - \frac{u_n - u_{n-1}}{\Delta t}\right) (v-u_n)$$
because in fact $u_n=u_{n-1}=0$ and $v-u_n = v \ge 0$ on $\Omega_n^0$, and because \eqref{eq:inequalityonzero} says that $F_n \le 0$ on $\Omega_n^0$.  Almost the same, by \eqref{eq:vanishingQn} on $\Omega_n^r$,
    $$\int_{\Omega_n^r} (\Div \bQ_n) (v-u_n) = \int_{\Omega_n^r} (0) (v-u_n) \ge \int_{\Omega_n^r} \left(F_n - \frac{u_n - u_{n-1}}{\Delta t}\right) (v-u_n)$$
because in fact $u_n=0$ and $v-u_n = v \ge 0$ on $\Omega_n^0$, and because \eqref{eq:inequalityonretreat} says that $F_n - (u_n - u_{n-1})/\Delta t = F_n + u_{n-1}/\Delta t \le 0$ on $\Omega_n^0$.  Thus if we return to \eqref{eq:equalitybeforeVI} we have
\begin{align}
-\int_{\Omega} \bQ_n \cdot \grad(v-u_n) &\ge \int_{\Omega_n} \left(F_n - \frac{u_n - u_{n-1}}{\Delta t}\right) (v-u_n) - \int_{\partial \Omega} G_n (v-u_n) \label{eq:essentiallyVI} \\
  &\qquad\quad + \int_{\Omega_n^r \cup \Omega_n^0} \left(F_n - \frac{u_n - u_{n-1}}{\Delta t}\right) (v-u_n). \notag
\end{align}

We want to be able to pose our problem (weakly) so that the decomposition $\Omega = \Omega_n \cup \Omega_n^r \cup \Omega_n^0$ is not needed to pose the problem.  But \eqref{eq:essentiallyVI} can be written without that decomposition!:
\begin{equation}
-\int_{\Omega} \bQ_n \cdot \grad(v-u_n) \ge \int_{\Omega} \left(F_n - \frac{u_n - u_{n-1}}{\Delta t}\right) (v-u_n) - \int_{\partial \Omega} G_n (v-u_n) \label{eq:morallytheVI}
\end{equation}
This is our variational inequality weak form, in which the free boundary does not appear in posing the problem.

\begin{definition}  Fix $p>1$.  Let
    $$\mathcal{K} = \left\{v \in W^{1,p}(\Omega) \,\big|\, v(x) \ge 0 \text{ for all } x \in \Omega\right\}.$$
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}  We say $u_n \in \mathcal{K}$ \emph{solves the one-time-step (weak) problem} if 
\begin{align}
\int_{\Omega} u_n (v-u_n) - \Delta t\, \bQ_n \cdot \grad(v-u_n) + &\Delta t \int_{\partial \Omega} G_n (v-u_n) \ge \label{eq:theVI} \\
  &\qquad\qquad \int_{\Omega} \left(u_{n-1} + \Delta t F_n\right) (v-u_n) \notag
\end{align}
\end{definition}
for all $v \in \mathcal{K}$.
