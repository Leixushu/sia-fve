* idea about doing searchs:  run with "-mah_dtBE 10.0" or similar; if converges
  but recovery was necessary, restart with "-mah_read foo/unnamed.dat -mah_readinitial -mah_notry -cs_start 8"
  or similar; this *does* seem to promote convergence for steady-state problem

* compute time-step restriction for BE recovery using layer-conserve theory;
  just print it

* have schedule of recovery time steps 1,10,100,1000,10000 ?

* for grn/robust/ runs, compute execution time ratio SSLS/RSLS for each pair of
  runs
