* add to history file "first continuation level where recovery mode is on";
  negative if no recovery

* have -mah_averr and -mah_maxerr write
2.34567e+02 RECOVERY
  or similar if recovery was necessary for convergence, while write
DIVERGED_LINE_SEARCH
  or similar if diverged (as now)

* idea about doing searchs:  run with "-mah_dtBE 10.0" or similar; if converges
  but recovery was necessary, restart with "-mah_read foo/unnamed.dat -mah_readinitial -mah_notry -cs_start 8"
  or similar; this *does* seem to promote convergence for steady-state problem
