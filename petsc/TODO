* add ability to smooth bed in preprocessing script (poss. in grn2petsc.py so it can be run from either grn/ or grn/mcb/)

* add D diagnostic by creating new local Vec from quadda and (under option) filling it by a call to getflux() which also returns the D value.  Show the resulting D by averaging over 4 quadrature points per element?

* if the analysis of this shows that D is high where residual is large, in nonconvergent cases, then add code to smooth out the D values
